    <h3>Topic 2: Nucleic Acids </h3>
    <h4> Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA are polynucleotides made out of nucleotide monomers. Each Nucleotide is made out of a pentose sugar, an inorganic phosphate and a nitrogenous base.
      <br> <br> What are the differences and similarities between DNA and RNA?</h4>
